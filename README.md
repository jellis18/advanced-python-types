# Advanced Typing Concepts in Python

This is a companion repository to the blog post [here](). All of the code in the post is available here for further exploration.

## Setup

To setup your environment and install the dependencies do

```bash
python3.10 -m venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I would recommend using vscode using Pylance but I'm sure other IDEs would be fine.
